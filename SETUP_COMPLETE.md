## 🔧 How It Works

```
User fills form → Frontend sends request → Backend API processes
                                         ↓
                                    Calls external APIs:
                                    • Google Search
                                    • Firecrawl
                                    • OpenRouter
                                    • Google Sheets
                                         ↓
                                    Returns results → Shows in UI
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Make sure your `.env` file has:

```env
# Google Search
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your_engine_id

# Google Sheets
GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID=your_sheet_id
# Plus credentials (service account)

# Firecrawl
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_key

# OpenRouter
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### Before (CLI):
```bash
$ npm start
Enter search keyword: _
Enter search location: _
Do you want to save to Google Sheets? (yes/no): _
```

### After (Web Interface):
- Fill form → Click button → See results
- Visual progress tracking
- Works on any device
- Beautiful modern UI
- No command line needed

## 🔄 Both Methods Still Work!

You can still use the command line if you prefer:
```bash
npm start          # Search
npm run extract    # Extract contacts
npm run email      # Generate emails
```

Both methods work with the same Google Sheet - no conflicts!

## 📱 Access From Any Device

Since it's a web interface, you can:
- Use on Windows, Mac, Linux
- Access from tablet or phone (on same network)
- Share screen easily for demos
- No terminal knowledge needed for teammates

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Server won't start?
- Check port 3000 is free
- Run `npm install` first
- Check for error messages

### Can't access at localhost:3000?
- Make sure server is running
- Try `http://127.0.0.1:3000` instead
- Check firewall settings

### API errors?
- Verify `.env` file is configured
- Check API keys are valid
- Ensure Google Sheets is shared with service account

### Need help?
- See **WEB_INTERFACE_GUIDE.md** for detailed troubleshooting
- Check **GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md** for Sheets configuration
- Original CLI tools still work if needed!

## 🎓 Next Steps

1. **Test It Out**
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:3000

2. **Try a Small Test**
   - Search for 30 results
   - Extract contacts for 1-3 records only
   - Generate emails for those same 1-3

3. **Scale Up**
   - Once comfortable, process more records
   - Use batch processing for large datasets
   - Monitor your Google Sheet for results

4. **Customize** (Optional)
   - Edit `public/index.html` for UI changes
   - Edit `server.js` for API behavior
   - Add new features as needed

## 🎊 You're All Set!

Everything is ready to go. Just run:
