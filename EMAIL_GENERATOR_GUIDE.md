## üìß Generated Email Format

The generated email follows this structure:

```
Hi [COMPANY_NAME],


I've long admired your company. [SPECIFIC_ADMIRATION]

I am Jordan. We specialize in providing enterprise AI services for companies or individuals in need of AI transformation. We have assisted many businesses in using AI to streamline operations, double their performance, perfectly create brand characteristics, and enhance customer engagement. I wonder if you would be interested in having a brief conversation to see how we can assist your company? Looking forward to your reply!


Best regards,
Jordan
```

### Line Spacing

- ‚úÖ 2 blank lines after header (Hi [Company])
- ‚úÖ 1 blank line between paragraphs
- ‚úÖ 2 blank lines before footer (Best regards)

## üé® How It Works

1. **Read from Google Sheets**
   - Connects to your spreadsheet using service account
   - Reads company names from column F (Company Name)
   - Reads website URLs from column D (Link)
   - Checks which records need emails generated

2. **Fetch Website Content**
   - Downloads the HTML from each URL
   - Extracts text content using Cheerio
   - Removes scripts, styles, navigation
   - Limits to 3000 characters for efficiency

3. **AI Analysis**
   - Sends content to DeepSeek model via OpenRouter
   - Uses structured output (JSON) for reliability
   - AI finds specific, genuine things to admire about each company
   - Generates personalized admiration sentence

4. **Email Generation**
   - Formats email with proper spacing
   - Inserts company name and admiration
   - Creates professional outreach email

5. **Update Google Sheets**
   - **Immediately** writes email to column I (Sales Email)
   - Updates happen before processing next record
   - Safe even if script stops mid-processing

6. **Retry on Failure**
   - If generation fails, automatically retries (up to 3 attempts)
   - Waits 3 seconds between retry attempts
   - Skips record if all attempts fail

## üìä Google Sheet Structure

Your Google Sheet should have these columns (created automatically by previous steps):

| Column | Name          | Description                              | Filled By           |
|--------|---------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| A      | Timestamp     | When search was performed                | search.js           |
| B      | Search Query  | Original search query                    | search.js           |
| C      | Title         | Website title                            | search.js           |
| D      | Link          | Website URL                              | search.js           |
| E      | Snippet       | Search result snippet                    | search.js           |
| F      | Company Name  | Extracted company name                   | extract_contacts.js |
| G      | Telephone     | Extracted phone number                   | extract_contacts.js |
| H      | Contact Email | Extracted contact email                  | extract_contacts.js |
| I      | Sales Email   | AI-generated personalized email          | **generate_email.js** |

## üîß Customization

### Change the AI Model

Edit `generate_email.js` around line 229:

```javascript
const model = 'deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free';  // Current model (free)
```

Other options:
- `'openai/gpt-4o'` - Very creative, costs ~$0.01 per email
- `'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet'` - Excellent quality, costs ~$0.015 per email
- `'google/gemini-pro'` - Good quality, costs money
- `'deepseek/deepseek-chat'` - Paid version, very cheap (~$0.0001 per email)

See [OpenRouter Models](https://openrouter.ai/models) for all options.

### Modify Email Template

Edit the `formatEmail` function in `generate_email.js` (around line 305):

```javascript
function formatEmail(companyName, admiration) {
  return `Hi ${companyName},


I've long admired your company. ${admiration}

[YOUR CUSTOM CONTENT HERE]


Best regards,
[YOUR NAME]`;
}
```

### Change Sender Name

Replace "Jordan" in the template with your name.

### Adjust Retry Settings

Edit `processBatch` function call in `generate_email.js` (line 374):

```javascript
const emailResult = await generateEmailWithRetry(result.companyName, webContent, 3);
//                                                                               ^ Change this number
```

### Change Processing Delay

Edit the delay between records (line 403):

```javascript
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); // 2 seconds, change as needed
```

## üí∞ Cost

### Using Free Model (Default)

- **DeepSeek Free Model**: $0 per request ‚úÖ
- No credit card required
- Rate limits apply (but generous)

### Using Paid Models

- **DeepSeek Paid**: ~$0.0001 per email (extremely cheap)
- **GPT-4o**: ~$0.01 per email
- **Claude 3.5**: ~$0.015 per email

**Example for 100 emails:**
- DeepSeek Free: **$0**
- DeepSeek Paid: **$0.01**
- GPT-4o: **$1.00**
- Claude 3.5: **$1.50**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Error: OPENROUTER_API_KEY not found

Your `.env` file needs:
```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key-here
```

Get your API key at https://openrouter.ai

### Error: GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID not found

Make sure your `.env` has:
```env
GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id
```

Or create `.google-credentials.json` - see [GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md](GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md)

### Error: No data found in the sheet

You need to run the previous steps first:
1. `npm start` - Search for websites
2. `npm run extract` - Extract contact information
3. Then run `npm run email`

### Error: Failed to fetch web content

- Check if the URL is accessible
- Some websites block scrapers - the script will skip these
- Make sure the URL includes `http://` or `https://`

### Generic admiration sentences

- Try processing records with more detailed websites
- The homepage might not have enough specific information
- Consider using a paid AI model (GPT-4o, Claude) for better quality
- Check if the website has sufficient text content

### "Failed to generate email after retries"

- Check your OpenRouter API key is valid
- Check if you have rate limit issues (wait and try again)
- Verify your internet connection
- Try a different AI model

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Process in small batches**:
   - ‚úÖ Start with 5-10 emails
   - ‚úÖ Review quality before processing more
   - ‚úÖ Avoid hitting API rate limits

2. **Review before sending**:
   - Always read generated emails in the spreadsheet
   - Verify the admiration makes sense
   - Check for any issues or generic content

3. **Resume anytime**:
   - If interrupted, just run again and start from where you left off
   - Each email is saved immediately, so no data is lost

4. **Monitor your usage**:
   - Check [OpenRouter Dashboard](https://openrouter.ai/activity) for API usage
   - Free tier has rate limits but is generous
   - Consider upgrading if you need to process hundreds of emails

5. **Choose good websites**:
   - Records with clear company websites work best
   - About pages and product pages have good content
   - Avoid login pages, empty sites, or redirects

## üìö Examples of Good Admiration Sentences

‚úÖ **Good** (Specific):
- "Your innovative approach to web scraping and AI-powered data extraction truly stands out in the industry"
- "The way you've simplified API integration with your unified endpoint is impressive"
- "Your commitment to making complex data accessible to developers of all skill levels is admirable"

‚ùå **Bad** (Generic):
- "your great products"
- "your innovative company"
- "your excellent service"

The AI is trained to be specific! If you get generic results:
- Try records with more informative websites
- Consider using a better AI model (GPT-4o, Claude)
- Make sure the website has sufficient content

## üöÄ Advanced: Command Line Arguments (Legacy)

You can still use the old method if needed:

```bash
node generate_email.js https://example.com "Company Name"
```

But the interactive Google Sheets method is recommended for batch processing!

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Start small**: Process 3-5 emails first to test quality
2. **Check the sheet**: Review generated emails before sending
3. **Adjust as needed**: Customize the template for your use case
4. **Track results**: Note which emails get responses
5. **Iterate**: Improve your template based on what works

## üìä Success Metrics

After processing your batch, you'll see:

```
========================================
üìä Batch Generation Summary:
========================================
  üìç Processed records: 1 to 10
  ‚úÖ Successfully generated: 8
  ‚ùå Failed: 1
  ‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped (no link/name): 1
  üìù Batch total: 10
  ‚è∞ Batch time: 1.2 minutes
========================================

‚úÖ Success rate: 80.0%
```

Good success rates are typically 80-95%, depending on website quality.
