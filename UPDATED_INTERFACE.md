# 🎨 Updated Web Interface - Flexible Workflow

## ✨ What Changed

The interface has been updated to provide **more flexibility**! Instead of a strict 3-step sequential process, you now have:

### New Flow

**Step 1: Search** 🔍
- Search for companies (same as before)
- Save results to Google Sheets

**Step 2: Process Data** ⚙️
- **Both Extract Contacts AND Generate Emails are available simultaneously**
- You can choose which operation to run first
- You can run them independently
- You can run them multiple times on different ranges

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. **No Forced Sequence**
Before: Search → Extract → Email (must follow this order)

After: Search → Choose what you want to do (Extract or Email, in any order)

### 2. **Simultaneous Access**
Both tools are visible and accessible at the same time in Step 2:

```

│  Step 2: Process Data                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│  📞 Extract Contact Information             │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐   │

│  │ [Extract Contacts]                  │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                             │
│  ✉️ Generate Sales Emails                  │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │ From Entry: [1]  To Entry: [10]    │   │
│  │ [Generate Emails]                   │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                             │
│  [Start New Search]                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. **Independent Operations**
- Want to only extract contacts? Just use the Extract section
- Want to only generate emails? Just use the Email section
- Want to do both? Use both sections, in any order

### 4. **Batch Processing Flexibility**
- Extract contacts for entries 1-10
- Generate emails for entries 1-5
- Extract more contacts for entries 11-20
- Generate more emails for entries 6-10
- Any combination you want!

## 📋 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard Flow
1. Search for 30 companies
2. Extract contacts for entries 1-10
3. Generate emails for entries 1-10

### Example 2: Email First
1. Search for 30 companies
2. Generate emails for entries 1-5 (if you already have contact info)
3. Extract contacts for entries 6-30 (fill in missing data)

### Example 3: Batch Processing
1. Search for 30 companies
2. Extract contacts for entries 1-10
3. Review results in Google Sheet
4. Extract more contacts for entries 11-20
5. Generate emails for entries 1-10
6. Generate more emails for entries 11-20

### Example 4: Selective Processing
1. Search for 30 companies
2. Only extract contacts (don't generate emails)
3. Review and manually select which companies to reach out to
4. Generate emails only for selected entries

## 🎨 Visual Changes

### Before (3-step indicator):
```
● ━━━━ ○ ━━━━ ○
1. Search  2. Extract  3. Email
